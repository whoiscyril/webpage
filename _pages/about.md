Hi, I am a PhD student in theoretical and computational chemistry at University College London. Specialised in using numerical methods to treat complex periodic atomic structures, my current project focuses on developing novel theoretical methods to calculate lattice properties of 2D materials under periodic boundary conditions. Specifically, I am interested in the behaviours of defects in layered materials and their industrial applications. I obtained my MSc. degree at University College London with high distinction, and my BSc. degree at Imperial College London.

My work has been [published](publications) or is forthcoming in
among other outlets. My [research](research) explores the causes and
consequences of political violence using a broad variety of methods such as
latent variable models, geospatial analysis, and big data. While I primarily
focus on civil conflict, I also examine contentious political phenomena
including terrorism and economic statecraft, and develop new measures of
institutions in international relations. I have [teaching](teaching) experience
in both international relations and quantitative methodology, and am a certified
instructor with [The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/).
