Research plays a central role in my teaching as students improve their
analytical skills and master the tools of computational chemistry through hands-on
experience. I have taught a range of mathematics, physics and chemistry modules at both graduate 
and undergraduate level at UCL. 
I also served as a teaching assistant for computational labs in the physical chemistry
section at UCL, as well as leading undergrdaute tutorials for one year
